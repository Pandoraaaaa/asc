        <h4>Automatic processing</h4>
        <p>For many rations at a time, this program finds a balanced ration, saves it as the current ration, prints the balanced ration, a batch sheet, and a feed label, and writes the ration to a file. Automatic processing is particularly useful after ingredient prices have changed and your balanced rations are no longer least-cost rations. Select multiple rations.</p>

        <h4>Parametrics</h4>
        <p>Produce different, balanced, least-cost rations by varying the price of an ingredient, the minimum or maximum percentage of an ingredient, and the minimum or maximum amount of a nutrient. Use parametrics to fine tune your rations by seeing the effects of small changes in prices or constraints. A company involved in commodity sales can use parametrics to evaluate their own ingredients relative to similar ingredients with fixed costs.</p>

        <h4>Feed labels</h4>
        <p>Make commercial feed labels that conform to the Model Bill of the "Association of American Feed Control Officials" of the United States, or the "Feeds Regulations" of Canada. MixitWin saves label information for later use, and can send a finished label to a word processor allowing you to change lettering styles and add graphic elements. Send a feed label to a pre-formatted template in Microsoft Word.</p>

        <h4>Inventory</h4>
        <p>Maintain accurate records of current ingredient amounts and prices, rations that are mixed, rations that leave the feed mill, a history of amounts and costs, and ingredients to be reordered. Compare the cost of replacing the inventory with the actual or average cost. Send rations to a feed mill computer, receive ingredients mixed by a feed mill computer, and receive rations sold by an invoice of the Prices program (see below.)</p>

        <h4>Prices</h4>
        <p>Print price sheets and customer invoices. A price sheet is a list of rations showing wholesale prices, retail prices, and/or prices per bag. Up to four price columns are printed, with full control of the prices shown. Each price on the price sheet is the result of up to four markups for manufacturing costs, freight charges, etc. Eight different price sheets can be produced. Save customer names and prices and print customer invoices; send customer names and invoices to QuickBooks. The ration amounts on invoices can also be subtracted from the Inventory program (see above.)</p>

        <h4>Clients</h4>
        <p>Keep separate ingredient prices for hundreds of clients, plants or feedmills in a Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet and import these prices into MixitWin.</p>

        <h4>EggPro</h4>
        <p>Store nutrient profiles on a weekly basis for any breed of laying hen and any nutrient. Data for several breeds are provided with the EggPro program, and you enter and save data for other breeds. EggPro also saves information about each layer house. This information includes the breed, current feed intake, date of the last ration, actual age of birds, adjusted age of birds, and current production of the house. EggPro enters requirements into formulas that MixitWin balances at a later time using the Automatic Processing program. EggPro was written under the direction of Woodie Williams (PhD in Nutrition and Biochemistry).</p>

        <h4>MultiMixit</h4>
        <p>MixitWin finds balanced, least cost rations under the assumption of unlimited ingredient inventory. When MixitWin balances a ration, it assumes there is enough of each ingredient on hand to make any amount of the ration. MultiMixit finds balanced, least cost rations under the assumption of limited inventory. You specify the amount of each ration to mix and the amount of each ingredient on hand and MultiMixit calculates the best way to mix these rations so that each ration is balanced and the total amount of all rations is least cost. You can also specify minimum ingredient amounts in order to force MultiMixit to use these ingredient amounts in the rations. If the Inventory program (see above) is available, MultiMixit uses the ingredient inventory to limit the amounts of ingredients in the balanced formula.</p>

        <h4>BeefPro</h4>
        <p>A feedlot profit projection program. BeefPro shows the profitability of feeding out and finishing cattle that are kept in pens and fed according to a feeding schedule. The output shows the profit report, the break-even buying price and break-even selling price of the animal, and the break-even feed prices for the feeding schedule currently selected. A buy/sell report, feed cost report, and gain/intake report are also shown.</p>
