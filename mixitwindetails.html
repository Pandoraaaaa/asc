                    <p>The purpose of MixitWin is to create, display, and export rations. MixitWin lets you create two types of rations. In the first type you select the ingredients and their amounts and MixitWin calculates the nutrient content of the ration (this is a "hand-entered ration"). In the second type you select the ingredients and specify constraints that the ration must satisfy, such as minimum or maximum amounts of protein and wheat, and MixitWin selects the ingredient amounts for you (this is a "balanced ration"). Linear programming guarantees that a balanced ration is also a least-cost ration. There are many suggestions for balancing a ration when ingredients do not meet the constraints.</p>

                    <summary>Unique Features</summary>
                    <p>When balancing a least-cost ration there is no limit, except computer memory, to the number of ingredients, nutrients and constraints you may use. In practical terms, this means you can save thousands of ingredients, nutrients and rations in a single database and use hundreds of ingredients, nutrients and constraints in making a balanced, least-cost ration.</p>
                    <p>Get specific help with balancing rations. A balanced, least-cost ration is not possible if the ingredients that you select cannot meet your ingredient, nutrient and ratio constraints. In this case MixitWin provides very specific help. An example of this help is the message "Lower the minimum of Protein to 12.907 or include ingredients high in Protein."</p>
